## 1. Social Media Dashboard
### Project Overview
A Social Media Dashboard allows users to view and manage their social media feeds (such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) in one place. Users can log into their social media accounts, and the dashboard will display their posts, likes, comments, and allow them to post updates. It will also offer features like analytics and sentiment analysis to enhance user experience.
