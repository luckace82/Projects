## 1. Social Media Dashboard
### Project Overview
A Social Media Dashboard allows users to view and manage their social media feeds (such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) in one place. Users can log into their social media accounts, and the dashboard will display their posts, likes, comments, and allow them to post updates. It will also offer features like analytics and sentiment analysis to enhance user experience.
### Functional Requirements
**1. User Authentication**
- Login/Signup: Users must be able to log in and sign up using their email or via social media accounts (OAuth for integration with platforms like Google, Facebook).
- User Profiles: Users can manage their profile with basic details  such as username, profile picture, and bio.
- Session Management: Store user sessions for easy navigation between pages without requiring a new login.
